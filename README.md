# lists_algos

### *INFO*

Theory implementation of the I.T. university course.

`searching_algo.h` contains all the searching algorithms studied during the course.
Inside the book they were implemented as a simple "**contains**" function that return *TRUE* or *FALSE*.
With my implementation, I thought that it could be better if these functions returns the actual index
instead of a simple flag.

`sorting_algo.h` contains 4 sorting algorithms from *bubble* to *quick* one.

`lists` directory contains 3 lists implementations. One is the standard **linked list**, the other
two are created by the professor to use *static* arrays instead of the *dynamic* ones.
